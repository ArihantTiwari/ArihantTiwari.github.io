As a part of BESPOKE/MUGS3 collaboration, the goal of the project was to produce close simulated matches to
nearby galaxies including several aspects simultaneously: star formation rates and properties of star clusters, stel-
lar and dark matter dynamics, gas distribution and phases, molecular cloud properties, turbulence and magnetic
fields. We used individual nearby real galaxies which have tight relations in these properties with a much smaller
spread than the galaxy population as a whole which provided a stringent test of our understanding of galaxies
and how these relation fundamentally arise from the properties specific to each galaxy. A paper concluding the
finding is under review in MNRAS. The project had several participants including faculty, postdocs and graduate
students both at McMaster University and internationally.
